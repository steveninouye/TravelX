Key features:

- Generate a travel plan based on a destination city
- See a schedule of popular attractions for destination city
- View attractions in both schedule and map view
- Beautiful and intuitive user experience

This project was created in 7 days by a team of software developers at App Academy, the nation's #1 coding bootcamp with a 3% acceptance rate.

Our goal was to create a useful and beautiful travel planning app that anyone could use to make travel planning easier. As a team, we were also interested in learning Material UI, the most popular React library, and the Google Places API.
